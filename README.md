# Role-Based Access Control App

The **Role-Based Access Control App** is a web application built using the Go programming language and the Gin web framework. It provides a role-based authentication and authorization system that restricts access to different parts of the application based on user roles. This project showcases the implementation of role-based access control using middleware, models, and controllers.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to the application using their credentials.
- **Role Management**: The application supports different user roles, including admin, moderator, and client.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Each user is assigned a role upon registration, and different routes are protected based on the user's role.
- **Dashboard Views**: Users with different roles can access their respective dashboards displaying role-specific information.

## Technologies Used

- **Go Programming Language**: The core language used to develop the application.
- **Gin Web Framework**: A lightweight web framework for building web applications in Go.
- **GORM**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library used for interacting with the database.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for authentication and creating secure tokens.
- **godotenv**: A tool used to manage environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **MySQL**: The database used to store user information and roles.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured design with directories for controllers, models, middlewares, and routes. The user authentication, role-based authorization, and dashboard routes are defined within these directories.

``` bash
role_based_app/
├── controllers/
│   ├── admin_controller.go
│   ├── auth_controller.go
│   ├── client_controller.go
│   └── moderator_controller.go
├── middlewares/
│   ├── admin_role_required.go
│   ├── client_role_required.go
│   ├── cors_middleware.go

├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── main.go
```


## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file and configure your environment variables (database connection, secret, etc.) as in the envExample.txt.
3. Run `go mod download` to download the project dependencies.
4. Start the application by running `go run main.go`.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrating Real Life Problem Case and Building An MVP.
- Security Enhancement and Developing Structure As Per Standard Need.
- Implementing user profile management for different roles(dynamic).
- Adding more detailed error handling and validation.
- Enhancing the frontend with responsive design and interactive elements.
